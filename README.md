Automatic indexes Selection for Nova SeqX
==========================================

R script to automatically select indexes combinations for sequencing.

The criteria are
* each index position pool, G<50%
* each index position pool, C+T>30%.

The example used are randomly generated i7 and i5 instead of the real sets.

Assume we have 30 pairs and need to select 5 indexes to pool.
